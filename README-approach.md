This project has 2 goals:
* Learning basics of Quarkus by doing
* Trying to combine that with good Java and functional programming practices, such as:
  + Immutability and use of immutable records
  + Immutability even for collections, using Guava immutable collections
  + Use of non-default constructors in order to have sufficient control over the "state space" of a class
  + Organizing code in a layered way, with the service layer being exposed as Java interface
